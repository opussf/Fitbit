# Fitbit

This addon came from an idea from a comment from a raid run.

## What it does

Keeps track of "steps" that a character takes.

## Notes

Things I can determine:

When a player changes speed.
Stops, starts running, starts walking.

Based on this, I can determine how long a player has been at that speed.
Define a number of steps per second at each speed.

Allow this to be mapped based on the race of the character.

## Disclaimer

Hi Fitbit, and Google.
I hope that you take this addon for what it is, a fun extension into a game world.
A way to have your product name on people's minds, as an advertisement of sorts.

I would love to expand this addon into something even more fun.
